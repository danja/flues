A basic synth has been created, check the project knowledge. A weak point is the Interface module. Research more sophisticated algorithms reflecting physical systems that might offer better results, add a couple of hypothetical ones that bear little relationship to real systems but are implied by the others. Think deeply about how they may be incorporated into the existing system. The algorithms should be developed in a form such that on selection of an interface the single Intesity control will be adequate to make significant changes. Source code is not required, though consideration should be given to architectural requirements needed to support the different algorithms, shared code as appropriate. Present your findings as a markdown artifact.
