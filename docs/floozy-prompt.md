Can you create a new project called Floozy under lv2/floozy 
This will be a combination of disyn and pm-synth

The first row will be a module labelled Source. It will contain the same controls as were in Algorithms & Timbre in disyn plus a Level control for those (instead of Tone) plus Noise and DC from pm-synth.

Second row will be the Interface and Envelope modules from pm-synth.

Third row will be Delay Lines (Pipe & Delay from pm-synth). 

Fourth row Filter (Feedback & Filter from pm-synth).

Fifth row will be Modulation and Reverb.
